    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that.

    "i.\ty_tr_pred = train_mean * np.ones(len(y_train))\n",
    "ii.\ty_tr_pred = dumb_reg.train(X_train)\n",
    "b.\tusing either above will produce the same result; this is cross-validation in a sense\n",
    "5.\tWhen calling on the r_squared function using (y_train, y_tr_pred), the value returned is zero\n",
    "6.\tNext, we call on the same r_squared function using (y_test, y_te_pred); this time the function returned -0.0031 as the value\n",
    "a.\ty_te_pred = train_mean * np.ones(len(y_test))\n",
    "b.\t𝑅2 is a common metric, and interpretable in terms of the amount of variance explained, it's less appealing if you want an idea of how \"close\" your predictions are to the true values. Metrics that summarize the difference between predicted and actual values are mean absolute error and mean squared error.\n",
    "7.\tAfter calculating r_squred for the train and test sets, we went ahead and calculated the mean absolute error and mean squared error to better understand how close our model can predict the average ticket price/what variance can we expect\n",
    "8.\tAfter exploring the statistics portion of our initial training/test datasets, we can now start to model based in the training dataset\n",
    "9.\tFirst we are going to impute missing values with the median of each column\n",
    "a.\tX_defaults_median = X_train.median()\n",
    "b.\tX_tr = X_train.fillna(X_defaults_median)\n",
    "c.\tX_te = X_test.fillna(X_defaults_median)\n",
    "10.\tAfter that, we went ahead and scaled the data to account for the massive discrepancies regarding ranges and units of measure across the independent values (columns) via calling the StandardScaler function\n",
    "a.\tscaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "b.\tscaler.fit(X_tr)\n",
    "c.\tX_tr_scaled = scaler.transform(X_tr)\n",
    "d.\tX_te_scaled = scaler.transofrm(X_te)\n",
    "11.\tNow, we can finally train the model on the train split and test via calling on the LinearRegression.fit() function \n",
    "a.\tlm = LinearRegression().fit(X_tr_scaled, y_train)\n",
    "i.\tas you can see below, we are using the lm (regression fit based on the training dataset) to predict the test data\n",
    "b.\ty_tr_pred = lm.predict(X_tr_scaled)\n",
    "c.\ty_te_pred = lm.predict(X_te_scaled)\n",
    "12.\tAfter we predict the test dataset based on the training dataset, we need to better understand the model and its performance\n",
    "13.\tWhen calling on the r2_score function to compare our r_squares for the train and test datasets, we returned the following values: 0.817 for the train and 0.7209 for the test\n",
    "a.\tThis means that 81.7% of the expected variance for the y output (ticket price) is accounted for in our model\n",
    "b.\tThe test model only accounted for 72.1% and this could be due to the fact that we have made no effort to select a parsimonious set of features or deal with multicollinearity in our dataset; also, there could be some overfitting\n",
    "14.\tWe also computed the mean absolute error and mean squared error to further compare the trained and tested model \n",
    "a.\tMAE = 8.54 and 9.4 for the train and test datasets respectively \n",
    "i.\tWe expect that the estimated ticket price should be within $9 or so of the real price based on the model\n",
    "b.\tMSE = 111.89. and 161.73 for the train and test datasets respectively\n",
    "15.\tUnderstanding sklearn’s pipeline and SimpleImputer\n",
    "a.\tUsing the make_pipeline function within sklearn’s package allows us to impute, scale/build and train/test a model in an efficient manner\n",
    "i.\tBuilt in predict, imputer, scaler and linear regression modeling\n",
    "b.\tThe values returned for the mean squared error and mean absolute error were exactly the same as the process just prior to it\n",
    "16.\tNow, we understand the power of building a pipeline; next, we need to optimize the model and select the best features to focus on (SelectKBest)\n",
    "a.\tJust include SelectKBest(f_regression) within the make_pipeline call\n",
    "b.\tSelectKBest defaults to k = 10; meaning, you are including the 10 best features within the model \n",
    "c.\tOur results were worse when using the default setting k = 10\n",
    "d.\tThe key is to not use the modeling on the test dataset just yet\n",
    "e.\tYou could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",
    "f.\tThe way around this is a technique called cross-validation. You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set.\n",
    "17.\tWe must now use cross-validation methods in order to minimize overfitting by creating k-folds which essentially breaks down the training dataset into smaller components of training and testing data, so we still have the test dataset left untouched for advanced analysis\n",
    "18.\tIn order to do this, we need to instantiate k as k = [k+1 for k in range(len(X_train.columns))]\n",
    "a.\tThis will look at each feature (independent variable) and determine which k is best for training the model\n",
    "b.\tThis is also built into sklearn’s package as GridSearchCV\n",
    "19.\tBased on running the best k fit scenario, it appears as though including 8 features is the right decision; these features and their estimated influence on the model is shown below:\n",
    "a.\tVertical drop  10.76\n",
    "b.\tSnow making  6.29\n",
    "c.\tTotal_chairs  5.79\n",
    "d.\tfastQuads  5.745\n",
    "e.\tRuns  5.37\n",
    "f.\tLongest run  0.18\n",
    "g.\tTrams  -4.14\n",
    "h.\tskiableTerrain  -5.29\n",
    "20.\tLet’s take this a step further and use a random forest model to compare against the linear regression model using bestK \n",
    "a.\tFirst, we need to define the pipeline; for this, we will test imputing with the mean and median to determine which is better\n",
    "b.\tWhen calling on the GridSearchCV, we need to ensure that the right grid_params are used along with the pipeline (RF_Pipe)\n",
    "c.\tScaling the dataset didn’t do anything to the model, but imputing missing values with the median did help optimize the model \n",
    "d.\tBased on the random forest model, it looks like the fastquads, runs, snow_making acreage and vertical drop were the most important features in that order\n",
    "21.\tConclusion (selection being random forest modeling) \n",
    "a.\tWhen comparing the linear model to the random forest model, the random forest model exhibited less variability and accounted for more variance; it also produced consistent results more readily\n",
